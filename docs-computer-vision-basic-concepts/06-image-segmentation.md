## $\textnormal{Image Segmentation}$

> - `Image Segmentation` the division of an image into subparts <br />
    or sub-objects to demonstrate that the machine can discern <br />
    an object from the background or another object in the same <br />
    image.

> - This popular domain of Computer Vision has been studied widely <br />
    both with the use of traditional image processing algorithms <br />
    like watershed algorithms, clustering-based segmentation and <br />
    with the use of popular modern-day deep learning architectures <br />
    like PSPNet, FPN, U-Net, SegNet, etc.
