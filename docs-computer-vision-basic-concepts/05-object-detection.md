## $\textnormal{Object Detection}$

| Common Tasks in Computer Vision |
| ------------------------------- |
| ![common-computer-vision-tasks](./images/common-computer-vision-tasks.png) |

> - Refers to detection and localization of objects using <br />
    bounding boxes.

> - Object detection looks for class-specific details in an <br />
    image or a video and identifies them whenever they appear.

> - These classes can be cars, animals, humans, or anything <br />
    on which the detection model has been trained.

> - Previously methods of object detection used Haar Features, <br />
    SIFT, and HOG Features to detect features in an image and <br />
    classify them based on classical machine learning approaches.

> - This process, other than being time-consuming and largely <br />
    inaccurate, has severe limitations on the number of objects <br />
    that can be detected.

> - As such, Deep Learning models like `YOLO`, `RCNN`, `SSD` <br />
    that use millions of parameters to break through these <br />
    limitations are popular employed for this task.

> - Object detection is often accompanied by Object Recognition, <br />
    also known as Object Classification.
