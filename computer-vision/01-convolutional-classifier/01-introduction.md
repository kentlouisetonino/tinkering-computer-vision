### Convolutional Neural Networks
> - The neural networks that are best to understand a natural image well
    enough to solve the same kinds of problems the human visual system
    can solve.

> - Sometimes called as `convnet` or `CNN`.

> - `Convolution` is the mathematical operation that gives the layers of a
    convnet their unique structure.

### Image Classification
> - Given a picture, can we train a computer to tell us what it's a picture of?
    You may have seen apps that can identify a species of plant from a
    photograph. That's an image classifier.
